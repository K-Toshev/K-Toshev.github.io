# SWECC Hackathon 2025: UW Study Buddy
**Author: Kyle Toshev**

## Project Title & Brief Description:

This project **models** a quasi-social network for University of Washington students to find study partners in their courses. Users can input and search by course title, quiz sections, availability, and optional contact information.

## Important Caveats

This project is meant as a proof of concept. It is in no way meant to be an actual service. All storage is done locally in the browser alongside a demo data file, and is only meant to give the illusion of storage and authentication. The idea is for UW itself to have implemented a user authentication in line with other UW services, utilizing NetID or student email.
